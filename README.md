# Fork of 'becomingmaker'
Differs in the following ways:

* Fixed the USISerialSend example
* Changed the USISerialSend example to accomodate for faster and more reliable send transfers

Please also read [my post](//pascalroeleven.nl/2019/11/07/incredibly-fast-baud-rates-using-usi-uart-for-attiny/) that goes with this example and of course the [original article](//becomingmaker.com/usi-serial-send-attiny/) this fork is based on.
